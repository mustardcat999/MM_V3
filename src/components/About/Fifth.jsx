                                        <p>MarksMaster  strives hard to ensure that all solutions provided are correct with conceptual clarity and precision, and also submitted before the deadline so that students have the room to review the work and get back to us in case of any feedback. However due to rare occurrence of any unavoidable technical errors that may prevent you receiving your work or opening it properly - these circumstances are therefore outside of our control and guarantees. However, we promise that if the work was not completed on time or the grades were not satisfactory you'll get a full refund and the task for free. Although this scenario is extremely rare (maybe 1 in 1000 assignments)  , we have kept this policy to safeguard the interests of our clients and students.</p>
